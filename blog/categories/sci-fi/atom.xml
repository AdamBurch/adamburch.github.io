    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every month, I pick up a couple new books for my Kindle. This month, I started diving into some fiction.</p>

<p>The books I picked up, <em>Implied Spaces</em> by Walter Jon Williams and <em>The Way of Kings</em> by Brandon Sanderson parallel each other in a very odd way. The overarching questions in both these books is <em>Yay we won! What now?</em></p>

<p>Both feature societies that have achieved something incredible for their people. <em>The Way of Kings</em> Alethi have united under the banner of an (assassinated) king. In <em>Implied Spaces</em> we find a humanity that has conquered death, and so had to make new universes in which we <em>could</em> die. Incredible, <strong>AMAZING</strong> things.</p>

<p>But those things are past. The days of reunification are over in the minds of the Highprinces of Alethkar. Now there's <em>new</em> glory to be had! Mobs with the fattest of loot! Gemstones the size of your <strong>head</strong>![1]. And in sci-fi land, lacking mobs, humanity farmed realities instead.</p>

<p>This question hangs over the characters as well - Aristide of Earth is a wandering computer scientist-cum-swordsman, whose newfound purpose (stop his evil space twin from taking over humanity) kicks off the novel. Back in Roshar, we find the 'Blackthorn', Dalinar Kholin trying to cement his dead brother's kingdom, and finding diplomacy a pain in the ass compared to combat.</p>

<p>This is really odd to me, as growing up all the stories I read where about the great things that WERE GOING TO HAPPEN! Sure, high fantasy has always had settings in the ruins of past greatness, but even then there was a focus on what was to come. The past was a signpost, something that had come and gone and held SECRETS. Now the past isn't even past!</p>

<p>What really strikes me though is seeing this in SCI-FI. I always read about space exploration and expanding horizons. Reading about the post-singularity ennui/megalomania/immortality of humanity is a new experience.</p>

<p>Thanks books!</p>

<p>[1]I'm dead serious. Monsters that give magic gemstones on death are an actual major plot point. I'm liking this book!</p>
