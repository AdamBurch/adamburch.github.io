Alright, new projects new blog! My name is Adam David Burch, and I'm a programmer who's passionate about videogames. This blog will primarily be about my videogame projects, although it could stray to any topic at any time - perils of a blog!

This blog will update every Wednesday and Friday. Stay tuned!
