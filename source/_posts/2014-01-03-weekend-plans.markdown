My major focus this weekend is going to be finishing my ZZT game for ZZTV11[1]. I'm pretty sure I have a complete idea on what I'll need to do, I just need to sit down and DO IT. Hoping to talk a bit about it in my Wednesday post.

I finished *The Way of Kings* today. I think I'm going to enjoy this series - the characters are GREAT, the pacing is fast, the world is beautiful. Looking forward to book two in March!

And now I just added 50 more books my Amazon wishlist, and half of them are Discworld. Book life.
